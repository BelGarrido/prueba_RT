#The sphere is in the translated position (2.0, 0.0, 5.0).
#The highlight (specular spot) and shadows are computed based on this translated position, not the original one.
#There are no missing pixels or visual artifacts along the edges (no glitches).
#The side of the sphere closest to the light source is illuminated, while the opposite side remains in shadow.
